        <br />
        <p>
          Black Hills Gear is US Veteran owned company that fabricates
          Silencer/Suppressor MAD (Mirage Abatement Device) wraps which mitigate
          heat mirage thus enabling proper target acquisition. Suppressors can
          generate extreme heat temperatures while on the range, hunting with
          thermal night vision, or at say a long range competition. This
          endeavor started with using other covers on the market that wouldnâ€™t
          stay in place and charred away after minimal use. We test and evaluate
          our gear and always welcome feedback from our much appreciated
          customers. All Black Hills Gear is USA made and sources all materials
          from US suppliers.

          textiles, fabrication and repairs on various life-sustaining equipment
